        "\n",
        "But some may say \"It's still too complex to create a chunk.\" Can we just define a function and make it as a chunk? Because the main body of a chunk is basically the executor function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sure can do. Using decorator `@workflow.chunk()` provided by Agently workflow instance can make the chunk creation much more easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "读到这个案例的时候，你可能已经对**Agently Workflow**有了很多基本的概念理解，比如：如何创建流程块（chunk），如何连接流程块，如何启动连接好的workflow等等。\n",
        "\n",
        "不过可能还是有人会觉得，创建流程块这件事情是不是太复杂了？我们就不能直接把一个函数定义成流程块吗？因为从定义的视角看，一个流程块的主要内容就是它的执行函数。\n",
        "\n",
        "当然没问题。我们在workflow实例里提供了`@workflow.chunk()`装饰器，使用它，就能更加连贯一体地结合函数定义创建流程块（chunk）了。"

            "[Assistant]:  One tip about Rust is to use the borrow checker to your advantage. The borrow checker is a tool that helps you to ensure that your code is memory-safe. By understanding how the borrow checker works, you can write code that is more efficient and less error-prone. For example, you can use the borrow checker to help you to avoid data races and dangling pointers.\n",
            "[User]: Tell me more about it\n",
            "[Assistant]:  The Rust borrow checker is a tool that helps to ensure that your code is memory-safe. It does this by tracking the ownership and borrowing of data in your program. This helps to prevent data races and dangling pointers, which are two common sources of memory errors.\n",
            "\n",
            "The borrow checker works by enforcing a set of rules about how data can be borrowed. For example, a value can only be borrowed once at a time, and a borrowed value cannot be modified. These rules help to ensure that your code is always in a valid state, even if multiple threads are accessing the same data.\n",

            "* Use the `RefCell` and `Mutex` types to safely share mutable data between threads.\n",
