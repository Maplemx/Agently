## How to use "Agently Docs for Coding Agent"

- `agently-examples.zip` packaged a cheat-sheet file and some example codes which provide important usages examples and short guides that can help coding agents like Codex to understand how to use Agently to create language model based module with complex workflow and multi concurrency supported and how to package the module to RESTful API or streaming API.

- What you need to do is just create a dir named `docs` or something like that and unpackage all the files into it. Then tell the coding agent `"if you want to use Agently to develop language model based module or server, just read the cheatsheet file in dir 'docs'"` no matter in input area in coding agent's chat zone, or SKILL.md, or AGENT.md.

- We have already tried this and keep the result and the processing summary in `examples/ai_coding_using_Agently`. It works fine.

- Enjoy.
